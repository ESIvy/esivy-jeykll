When I first started the Miri books, my intention was to write pure fantasy, with magic and everything. Magic makes things easy. Yeah, I know you have to come up with rules but &#8211; need something? Make up a rule and bam, you have something. It&#8217;s magic!

The problem was, every time I got to the point in the story where Miri&#8217;s legs magically turned into tails, it just didn&#8217;t feel right to me. Even though other writers used it &#8211; in fact the original myths even used it &#8211; it still felt hollow and unbelievable. I mean, how could legs turn into tails?<!--more-->

Really.

I knew it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;real,&#8221; but still my brain wanted to understand _exactly_ how that could happen.

And then I saw a video of octopus camouflage.

And I believed.

Watch. And believe. ðŸ™‚
