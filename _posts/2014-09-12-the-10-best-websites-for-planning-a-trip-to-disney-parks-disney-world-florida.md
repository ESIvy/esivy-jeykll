We purchased the <a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/de81cy63y5LTSMPSOOLOPPNTSS" target="_blank">Disney World Base Tickets.</a> We didn’t get the park hopper option, and never even wished we’d had it. I think you’d only use this if your either a Disney veteran who goes several times a year, or someone who wants to see a tiny portion of every park in fewer than 4 days.
  2. <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank">tripadvisor.com</a>  &#8211; Comparing the cost of Disney Property to off-site, we chose to go with off-site. You can find <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g1954828-Disney_World_Florida-Hotels.html" target="_blank">all of the hotels around Disney World here.</a> But after reading a bunch of forums I narrowed my search down to finding one of the <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g34352-Kissimmee_Florida-Hotels.html" target="_blank">hotels near Disney Parks in Kissimmee, Florida.</a> <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34352-d3217188-Reviews-or10-BEST_WESTERN_PREMIER_Saratoga_Resort_Villas-Kissimmee_Florida.html#REVIEWS]" target="_blank">Best Western Premier Saratoga Resort Villas</a> is where we ended up staying. Be sure to check the <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34352-d3217188-Reviews-or10-BEST_WESTERN_PREMIER_Saratoga_Resort_Villas-Kissimmee_Florida.html#REVIEWS]" target="_blank">current reviews.</a>

Since we&#8217;ve gone, the folks at EasyWDW have put out a book, and I bet it&#8217;s as great as their website, <a title="Buy it on Amazon.
