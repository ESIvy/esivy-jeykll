I’ve seen print publishing’s answer to ebooks.

Many have predicted the end of paper books, that they&#8217;ll go the way of the stone tablet. Others have suggested they&#8217;ll persist only as expensive collector&#8217;s editions &#8211; elaborate coffee table books with burnished gold edges.

I was lucky enough to attend a book signing at <a href="http://bookpeople.com/" target="_blank">Book People in Austin</a> for Richard Peck’s new book, _The Mouse with the Question Mark Tail._ The future is already here. Richard Peck himself was quite pleased with the design of the book. I think he&#8217;s got ebooks to thank for it. For their Newbery Award winner, Penguin has turned out a stunning book.<!--more-->

The design starts with foil embossing on the front of the dust jacket and two-tone glossy printing on the back, but even the hard cover itself has a full color illustration.

The color continues to the inside, where every page has a touch of blue ink in the page folios and headers. First chapter pages have a two-color illustrations in blue and gray.

Every chapter has one or two full page illustrations &#8211; and not just in black and white, they&#8217;re done in blue. Some of Kelly Murphy&#8217;s lively illustrations have interesting perspective.

The book has 3 of these vibrant pages. It&#8217;s not many, but I’ve never seen glossy color pages in a middle grade book before. Richard Peck pointed out that it’s his first book with full page color illustrations. (And he&#8217;s written a lot of books!)

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">It really is a beautiful book. And they&#8217;ve done it all at a price in line with other hardcover children&#8217;s books, $16.99. Even though I got to Book People early before the talk so that I could connect my laptop to the WiFi for <a href="http://www.entangledpublishing.com/the-team/" target="_blank">Stacy Abrams&#8217;</a> SCBWI webinar on Best Practices in Digital Publishing, it was enough to make me want to buy a print book.</span>

So it&#8217;s time for me to quit writing this post and get back to trying to figure out how to format Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#8217;s Secret for CreateSpace. It won&#8217;t be the same as Richard Peck&#8217;s book, but it&#8217;s a start. And then I&#8217;d better do some real writing.

Because beautiful printing and illustrations aren’t all _The Mouse with the Question Mark Tail_ has going for it. Richard Peck is a master of storytelling. Even his author presentation was a masterful weaving of his inspiration, his life, his writing career, and humor.

Readers might pick up the book because of it’s beauty, but they’ll treasure it for the story.
