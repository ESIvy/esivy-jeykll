(Confetti and streamers compliments of my TechBoy! Aren&#8217;t they great? I would have added some cheering and clapping but it&#8217;s just annoying when you click on a website and your speakers start blaring. So, you&#8217;re welcome.)

<span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>As if finding out she&#8217;s a mermaid isn&#8217;t shocking enough, now Miri has to spend her summer at the bottom of the ocean!Â </em></span>

<span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>Slimy pets, weird and salty food,&#8230;Â </em></span>

<span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>Miri doesn&#8217;t think she&#8217;ll ever get used to any of it.Â </em></span>

<span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>But the mermaid city of Kai Kaona is so beautiful, she&#8217;s made some special friends, and she&#8217;s surprisingly good at hulikela, a type of underwater dancing. Then, just as she decides things aren&#8217;t too bad after all, the coronation crown is stolen. Is she going to be stuck at the bottom of the ocean forever?</em></span>

Find out how Miri copes with living at the bottom of the ocean and see what adventures she gets into. Check it out onÂ <a title="Buy it on Amazon!" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HKK1GYC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00HKK1GYC&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20" target="_blank">Amazon.</a>
