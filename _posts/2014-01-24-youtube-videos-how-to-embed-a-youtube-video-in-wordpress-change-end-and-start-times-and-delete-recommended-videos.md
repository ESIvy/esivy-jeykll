<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1725" alt="Youtube video in WordPress and customize" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Wordpress-youtube-tutorial-238-x-262.jpg" width="238" height="262" />This post I&#8217;ll cover Youtube videos in WordPress and Blogger. I&#8217;ll go over: how to embed a Youtube video, how to customize the Youtube video end times and start times, and how to delete the recommended videos, all without using a plugin. Plugins are great, but they can slow down your site. So if I can do without them, I do.

I couldn&#8217;t find this anywhere on the web and I&#8217;m tickled to death that I figured it out myself! I&#8217;m not a computer coder. So if I can do it, you can too. The beautiful part is that we&#8217;ll only be working in the text editor of your post. You won&#8217;t be touching any code that can mess up your entire site.<!--more-->

**A quick note before we get started. I&#8217;m wrapping up launch week for Miri Attwater and All that GlittersÂ with posts on two different blogs today.

I&#8217;m honored to have an <a title="Kirby's Lane" href="http://kirbyslane.blogspot.com/2014/01/friend-friday.html" target="_blank">author guest post over at the blog of Kirby Larson,</a>Â fabulous Newbery Honor author of Hattie Big Sky. It&#8217;s my very first guest post, and what a place to start out! Talk about intimidating. Hop over and check it out!

You canÂ <a href="http://lisaisabookworm.blogspot.com/2014/01/read-excerpt-from-childrens-book-miri.html" target="_blank">read an excerpt of Miri Attwater and All That Glitters</a> at the fabulous book blog, Bookworm Lisa. She focuses on family friendly books, so go on over and maybe you&#8217;ll find more than one book to read! \****

Okay, let&#8217;s get started with the WordPress tutorial for how to embed Youtube videos and customize them.

I foundÂ <a title="Youtube videos on WordPress" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/videos/youtube/" target="_blank">how to customize a Youtube video for WordPress.com</a>, but it doesn&#8217;t work for my <a title="wordpress.org" href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a> site. But I was able to modify it and make it work! Once you know the steps, it&#8217;s really simple. Bookmark this post in your browser so you won&#8217;t loose it. ðŸ˜‰

# How to embed a Youtube video in WordPress and customize it without a plugin

1. Start a new post in WordPress. When you first play around, you might just want to open up a post that has nothing in it. It makes finding your place in the text editor easier if there is nothing there!

2. Find a video you want to use on <a title="youtube videos" href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube.com.</a> You can use the same video I&#8217;m using for this tutorialÂ <a title="Youtube Biggest Aquarium" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7deClndzQw" target="_blank">Kuroshio Sea &#8211; 2nd largest aquarium tank in the world &#8211; (Please Don&#8217;t Go by Barcelona)</a>. I found this video while doing research for my book,Â <a title="Miri Attwater and the Oceanâ€™s Secret" href="http://esivy.com/miri-attwater-and-the-oceans-secret/" target="_blank">Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#8217;s Secret.</a>Â The images are awe inspiring. The people in front of the tank really give you a sense of the majesty of the ocean life. And the music is seriously gorgeous on this video. In fact, after watching this video I ended up buying <a title="Barcelona" href="https://myspace.com/barcelona" target="_blank">Barcelona&#8217;s</a> CD so I could enjoy more of their music. (Yes, I still buy CDs. Don&#8217;t judge me.)

## How to embed a Youtube video on WordPress so that you can customize it

If you follow the <a title="wordpress embed video" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds" target="_blank">WordPress directions to embed the video by just putting the web address without a hyperlink,</a> you won&#8217;t be able to customize it. So we&#8217;re going to embed it a different way.

3. In WordPress, change from the Visual editor to the Text editor.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1595" title="embed youtube video in wordpress text editor" alt="embed youtube video in wordpress" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/text-editor.jpg" width="450" height="184" srcset="https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/text-editor.jpg 450w, https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/text-editor-300x122.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" />
</p>

&nbsp;

4. Now go to the Youtube site of your video. Under the video you&#8217;re going to click: share <span style="color: #ff0000;">(1)</span>, embed <span style="color: #ff0000;">(2)</span>, and then you&#8217;re going to select and copy all of the code in <span style="color: #ff0000;">(3)</span>. Make sure you copy all of it Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C is a good way to do this on a PC.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1596" title="youtube video in wordpress share embed copy" alt="embed youtube video in wordpress share embed copy" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/share-embed-copy.jpg" width="450" height="243" srcset="https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/share-embed-copy.jpg 450w, https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/share-embed-copy-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" />
</p>

5. Go back to your WordPress post draft. Paste the text into the Text editing window.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/paste1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1597" title="youtube video in wordpress paste" alt="youtube video in wordpress paste" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/paste1.jpg" width="600" height="99" srcset="https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/paste1.jpg 600w, https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/paste1-300x49.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>
</p>

6. Click Save Draft.

7. Now click Preview and you will get &#8230;.NOTHING! Now listen (or read), because this is very important: In your preview window, click &#8211; wait for it &#8211; click reload on your browser page. And wallah! The video will appear.

Thanks very, very much to the videoÂ <a title="embed youtube video in wordpress reload trick" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAdIN2Y2tyo" target="_blank">Embed YouTube Videos In WordPress Blog Posts Without Plugins</a> byÂ <http://www.theextremewebdesigns.com/>Â for that little reload trick. I was about to pull my hair about before I found their tip!

Here&#8217;s what mine looks like when I do that. Go ahead and watch the video while you&#8217;re here. Like I said, it&#8217;s gorgeous. I&#8217;ll wait.



Now, if you watched the video (Wait, you didn&#8217;t watch it? Really, watch it!) you&#8217;ll notice that a selection of suggested videos came up at the end. I have a blog that&#8217;s aimed for children (for my children&#8217;s mermaid adventure series, <a title="Miri on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Attwater-Oceans-Mermaid-Princess-Adventures-ebook/dp/B0087451I2/" target="_blank">Miri Attwater</a>). I don&#8217;t want the blog to even accidentally send them to any questionable material. So I wantedÂ to delete the recommended videos on Youtube from the end.

Now that I knew the reload trick, how to delete recommended videos on Youtube is pretty straightforward.

## How to delete recommended videos on Youtube

8. Â Go back to your video on Youtube. Under your embedding code, unclick &#8220;show suggested videos when the video finishes.&#8221;Â <span style="color: #ff0000;">(4)<span style="color: #000000;">. Copy the new codeÂ <span style="color: #ff0000;">(5).<span style="color: #000000;">Â Move back to your WordPress post editor, paste the new code in place of the previous code.</span></span></span></span>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1601" title="how to delete recommended videos on youtube video in wordpress" alt="how to delete recommended videos on youtube video in wordpress" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/deleted-suggested-videos.jpg" width="350" height="127" srcset="https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/deleted-suggested-videos.jpg 350w, https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/deleted-suggested-videos-300x108.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" />
</p>

Now when you preview your page (and hit reload), when you get to the video there won&#8217;t be any recommended videos on Youtube shown at the end.

Hmmm&#8230; but a few days later this video now does have ads. Well, I guess that&#8217;s a post for another day. Onward! Let&#8217;s change the start and end time.

I found out how to change the end and start time by trial and error. Here&#8217;s how you do it. (Without the trials and errors!)

## How to change a Youtube Â video&#8217;s start time

9. Decide where you want to start your video. Convert the start time into seconds.

I want to get the guy sticking his arms in the air, so I&#8217;m going to choose 26 seconds.

10. Now go back into your Text editing window for your WordPress post. Find where it says:Â ?rel=0&#8243;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1610" title="embed youtube video in wordpress rel=0" alt="embed youtube video in wordpress rel=0" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rel0.jpg" width="378" height="150" srcset="https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rel0.jpg 378w, https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rel0-300x119.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" />
</p>

Between the zero and the quotes, insert:Â &start=26

(Only replace 26 with what you want your start time to be, in seconds.)

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1614" title="embed youtube video on wordpress change start" alt="embed youtube video on wordpress change start" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/start.jpg" width="231" height="75" />
</p>

Save draft. Preview and reload. You&#8217;ll see that the start cursor will be down the video player timeline. Now let&#8217;s change the end time.

## How to change Youtube end time

11. Pick an end time for your video and convert it to seconds. I&#8217;m going to choose 1 minute 56 seconds which is 60 seconds + 56 seconds = 116 seconds.

12. Between your start time and the quote add: &end=116

Only replace 116 with your own end time.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1615" title="youtube end time customize youtube video in wordpress" alt="youtube end time customize youtube video in wordpress" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/end.jpg" width="305" height="91" srcset="https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/end.jpg 305w, https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/end-300x89.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" />
</p>

Save draft. Preview and reload. On the video player timeline you&#8217;ll see the segment that you&#8217;ve designated, like in my video below. You can click on my video to see how it works. Before you Publish, make sure your own works.



These directions to customize a Youtube video worked on my WordPress.org site, as well asÂ <a title="Miri Attwater" href="http://miriattwater.com" target="_blank">my blogger site, miriattwater.com.</a>

My main occupation is being an author and writing these tutorials takes some of my writing time. I debate if it&#8217;s a good place to spend my time, but I&#8217;d like to give back a little to the on-line community that makes help so readily available.
