So I&#8217;m thrilled that <a title="read Books Babies and Bows book review for parents of All That Glitters" href="http://booksbabiesandbows.blogspot.com/2014/01/miri-attwater-and-all-that-glitters-by.html" target="_blank">Books, Babies, and Bows has reviewed Miri Attwater and All that Glitters</a>.

Books, Babies, and Bows said that in All That Glitters _&#8220;&#8230;the masterfully laid out mystery in the book had us quickly turning pages&#8230;&#8221;_

On of the favorite parts for Jenny and her two daughters  was the scene where Miri visits a fish cleaning station to remove the algae growing on her skin. They wondered if there really are fish cleaning stations on the ocean. There are! When I first learned about them I was fascinated too. Next week, I&#8217;ll start a series of posts about fish cleaning stations.
