Happy Thanksgiving!

I made this turkey centerpiece out natural products for a very harvest-y looking centerpiece that&#8217;s not your traditional cornucopia! <!--more-->The base is a small grapevine wreath hot-glued to a grapevine ball for the body of the turkey. The tails i made out of small ears of harvest corn that you can buy in craft and grocery stores. They&#8217;re hot glued in place with the husks pulled up to add to the background of the tail. The head is made our of natural raffia wound around a wire and attached to the base of a pinecone for the neck ruff.

Placecard holders and napkin rings were made out of harvest corn, popcorn, and air dry clay.

This centerpiece lasted for several years, until bugs found it in storage, so be careful where you store it. You could also consider using artificial ears of corn.
