As I mention in [last weeks post about fish cleaning stations,](http://esivy.com/?p=1825) I didn&#8217;t intend to do any research for the Miri Attwater series. So when I did start doing some research, I wasn&#8217;t doing it like I would if I had been writing a non-fiction book about marine biology. I wasn&#8217;t taking a lot of detailed notes with page numbers and cross-referencing. I wasn&#8217;t double checking to see if information I got in one source could be confirmed by other sources. I wasn&#8217;t looking at a lot of original sources &#8211; meaning I wasn&#8217;t reading scientific research articles in marine biology journals. Because I know from my text book writing and editing work that there is lots of misinformation in science books and text books, and it gets copied when writers don&#8217;t go back to original sources. Writing a really well researched science book takes time &#8211; a lot of it. And it helps if you&#8217;re an expert in the field.

Really, my first goal for my research was to look at pretty pictures so I could make the underwater scenes in the book more real to the reader.

I probably shouldn&#8217;t have been surprised that the more I saw, the more amazed I became by the diversity of marine life. <!--more-->But I still wanted to write a fantasy, not a nonfiction informational book. So I didn&#8217;t keep detailed lists and notes of all the information I came across. I felt like if I did that kind of in-depth research and note taking, then I would start to develop a list of things that I wanted to include in the book. Then all the information would be in danger of taking over from the story. I wanted the story to be most important.

There were some subjects that I ended up reading in depth on both in books and on the web. Others things I thought were interesting, but I didn&#8217;t know immediately when I saw them that I would use them in the story. They just became some of my general background knowledge that I had about life in the ocean. The fish cleaning stations in the scene in <a title="Buy it on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HKK1GYC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00HKK1GYC&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20" target="_blank">Miri Attwater and all That Glitters</a> were one of those. I don&#8217;t know quite when it occurred to me that it would make a fun scene.

It wasn&#8217;t until I was reviewing videos for this series of posts that I realized something. In all the videos I was viewing, yellow tangs and other cleaner fish were eating algae off the backs of turtles. Wrasse were the cleaner fish cleaning sharks and rays, and lots of other fish &#8211; including yellow tangs. And when I viewed videos with commentary, they mentioned that wrasse were eating dead skin and parasites. They didn&#8217;t say anything about wrasse eating algae.

While I have both tangs and wrasse in the cleaning station scene, I have Miri and Fisk having the algae cleaned off them by wrasse. Oops! Did I make a mistake? Information about fish cleaning stations isn&#8217;t easy to find. I think perhaps it&#8217;s one of those areas of science that&#8217;s an emerging area of research. Maybe because as <a href="http://www.oneworldoneocean.com/blog/howard_hall_west_papua#.Uu7nJ_mwLwl" target="_blank">Howard Hall, and IMAX photographer, mentions in his notes while filming his latest movie, cleaner fish and cleaning can be disturbed by divers.</a> I did find a bunch of mentions on aquarium boards that people talked about their wrasse eating algae, but I still wasn&#8217;t sure.

I got really excited when I finally found this website: <a href="http://www.lexagrutter.com/cleaner%20fish%20do%20clean/cleaner%20fish%20do%20clean.htm" target="_blank">Cleaner Fish do Clean by Coral Reef Ecology Laboratory.</a> Now I could satisfy the only definitive way to be sure of an answer in science &#8211; ask an expert! I contacted Dr. Lex Grutter, and she was kind enough to answer me back. Sure enough, biologists consider wrasse carnivores, which means for a wrasse to clean Miri she would probably have to have a cut or be infected by parasites. Ooh, yuck!

It&#8217;s a pretty minor detail. Most readers are likely to only remember that Miri was cleaned by fish at a cleaning station and learn a little tiny bit more about the wondrous life under the ocean. And since some people have reported their aquarium wrasse eating algae, I could have satisfied the question by saying that the wrasse in Kai Kaona might act a little bit different. I do describe all the marine life in Kai Kaona as being transplanted from all over the world, like in our gardens and zoos.

But, I like to be as accurate as possible. So I tweaked the scene by having the cleaner fish that tickle Miri while they&#8217;re eating algae be yellow tangs instead. I&#8217;ll post the corrected excerpt on next week&#8217;s posts. I&#8217;ll also ask Amazon to make corrected versions available to readers who have already purchased, <a title="Buy it on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HKK1GYC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00HKK1GYC&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20" target="_blank">Miri Attwater and All That Glitters</a> as soon as I can get the new copy uploaded.

If you want to learn more about fish cleaning stations, here&#8217;s a great video to get a good overview of lots of different cleaner fish and their behaviors.
