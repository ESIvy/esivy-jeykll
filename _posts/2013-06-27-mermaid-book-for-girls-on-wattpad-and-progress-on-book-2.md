It&#8217;s been a while since I made a new post, I know!

And have you signed up for my [Newsletter](http://esivy.com/newsletter/ "Newsletter")? Because I&#8217;ve definitely made good on my promise not to fill up your inbox. üôÇ I&#8217;ve sent exactly, um, zero newsletters so far.

It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t love my [Newsletter](http://esivy.com/newsletter/ "Newsletter") subscribers! In fact there will be special offers soon, I promise. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s another thing with a learning curve. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to set up a sign up list. But how, exactly, do I send out a newsletter in the correct form? That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve got to figure out, and for now I&#8217;ve been trying to focus all my time on&#8230;

Completing Book 2!<!--more-->

(Okay, that and I may have snuck in a trip to Disney World. But hey, I was thinking of you and Miri! There are lots of mermaids at Disney. There&#8217;ll be some related posts later.)

But yes, <span style="color: blue; font-size: large;">Miri Attwater and All that Glitters</span> is starting the editing process!

Which means I already have some things that need some changes. üôÅ But hang tight, Book 2 will be better for it, and ready soon!

Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve started posting <a href="http://www.wattpad.com/story/5814158-miri-attwater-and-the-ocean%27s-secret" target="_blank">Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#8217;s Secret over on Wattpad</a>. I post a chapter or so a week. So, if you haven&#8217;t read the Ocean&#8217;s Secret yet and you can be patient for the next installment, hop on over to <a href="http://www.wattpad.com/story/5814158-miri-attwater-and-the-ocean%27s-secret" target="_blank">Wattpad</a> and say hello.

Happy Reading!
