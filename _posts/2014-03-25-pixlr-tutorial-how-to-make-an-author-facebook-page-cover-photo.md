If you&#8217;re using this as a Pixlr tutorial, we&#8217;ll be using <a title="pixlr" href="http://pixlr.com/" target="_blank">Pixlr</a> for free photo editing. In this post you will learn how to open an image from a web URL in Pixlr, how to undo in Pixlr, and I&#8217;ll introduce layers in Pixlr and image size in Pixlr (in other words, on images, what does 200 x 200 mean? What are pixels?).

I will assume that you know nothing about using Pixlr for on-line free photo editing. I only started using it a few months ago, so I really know what it&#8217;s like to know nothing. ðŸ™‚ Fortunately, I have a little Photoshop in my distant past and a resident Photoshop whiz, TechnoTim, for consulting.

In this series of posts, I&#8217;m going to show you step-by-step how to create a stunning cover photo using <a title="Pixlr" href="pixlr.com" target="_blank">Pixlr</a>Â forÂ free online photo editing.Â I&#8217;ll even provide a free Pixlr Facebook page cover photo template for Pixlr to make it easier!<!--more-->

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">To make your facebook cover photo, you&#8217;ll need to know </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="http://esivy.com/web-tutorials/how-to-create-facebook-author-page">why a book author needs a Facebook page instead of a profile.</a> <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">You also need to </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" title="signing up for a facebook page" href="http://esivy.com/web-tutorials/create-facebook-author-page-step-2-signing-facebook-page">sign up for your Facebook page</a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">. Did you do that? Go back and look at those posts. I&#8217;ll wait.</span>

Okay, now that you&#8217;re up to speed, you&#8217;re going to want to make a Facebook cover photo to pretty up your page.Â For inspiration I looked at the facebook pages of two indie author super-stars, <a title="Lindsay Buroker's facebook page" href="https://www.facebook.com/LindsayBuroker" target="_blank">Lindsay Buroker&#8217;s facebook page</a> and [J.F. Penn&#8217;s (of the CreativePenn.com) facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/TheCreativePenn)

Based on their designs, I made a cover photo for <a title="E.S. Ivy Facebook page" href="https://www.facebook.com/E.S.IvyAuthor" target="_blank">my own Facebook pag</a>e using Pixlr.

You can hop over and see the real thing on my facebook page,Â <a href="https://www.facebook.com/E.S.IvyAuthor" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/E.S.IvyAuthor.</a>

The first thing you&#8217;ll notice different from the image above and the one you see on the facebook page is that the cover photo above doesn&#8217;t have the profile photo. Facebook overlays that for you. Lots of tutorials just tell you to avoid that general area. But the perfectionist in me just couldn&#8217;t handle that! Exactly where that photo overlaps can really affect the aesthetics of the page. So I&#8217;ve created a template that you can use in Pixlr.com to make sure you get everything in exactly the right place.

The cover photo I created for my author Facebook page has a pretty specialized background based on the cover of <a title="Miri Attwater and the Oceanâ€™s Secret now available  with a new cover on Amazon!" href="http://esivy.com/other/miri-attwater-oceans-secret-now-available-new-cover-amazon/" target="_blank">Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#8217;s Secret.</a> To get the dimensions just right, Techno Tim had to add add some more art to original art files. You can do that if you have the skill, but for now I&#8217;m going to show you how to make a cover photo with an easier background.

You can think of it as Photoshop lite. The great thing is that it&#8217;s FREE. Completely free. You do all your editing on their webpage, Pixlr.com, and then save your files to your personal computer. I even used Pixlr to grab the images for this Pixlr tutorial!
</p>

Okay, let&#8217;s get started. To make a Facebook page cover photo like mine, you&#8217;re going to want to have images of your book covers saved to your computer. JPEG format will work; 300 x 400 will be more than big enough.

# Pixlr tutorial: to make a Facebook page cover photo using a Pixlr Facebook page cover photo template

1. Go to <a title="pixlr" href="http://pixlr.com/" target="_blank">Pixler.com</a>.

2. Choose Â Pixlr Editor.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1317" title="Pixlr tutorial: pixlr editor" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pixlr-editor.jpg" alt="Pixlr tutorial: pixlr editor" width="172" height="250" />
</p>

3. Choose Open Image from URL. (This way you won&#8217;t have to download my template to your computer. Pixlr will just open it directly from my site. So you don&#8217;t have to worry about downloading something you don&#8217;t know about to your computer. You _are_ careful about downloading things to your computer, right? Because really, you don&#8217;t know me from JoeVirus.)

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1319" title="Pixlr tutorial: open from url" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/open-from-url-262x300.jpg" alt="Pixlr tutorial: open from url" width="262" height="300" srcset="https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/open-from-url-262x300.jpg 262w, https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/open-from-url.jpg 434w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px" />
</p>

4. Now where you see this:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1322" title="Pixlr tutorial: image URL" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/image-URL.jpg" alt="Pixlr tutorial: image URL" width="271" height="174" />
</p>

copy and paste:Â www.esivy.com/files/covertemplate.pxd

The file extension &#8220;.pxd&#8221; is a special file just for using in Pixlr. It won&#8217;t open in any other type of program. Which means it won&#8217;t open on your computer, only in the Pixlr browser. So you&#8217;re computer is completely safe!

5. Now you should be seeing this! (Minus the red circles and numbers.)

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1324" title="Pixlr tutorial: pixlr areas" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pixlr-areas.jpg" alt="Pixlr tutorial: pixlr areas" width="400" height="227" srcset="https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pixlr-areas.jpg 400w, https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pixlr-areas-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />
</p>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span> &#8211; is the picture you&#8217;ll be working on. We&#8217;re going to call it the image area or picture area.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span> &#8211; is where you&#8217;ll choose which tools to use

<span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span> &#8211; is the navigator box where you can zoom in and out, choose layers, and see your editing history.

But don&#8217;t worry about remembering all that or trying to figure it out, I&#8217;m going to tell you everything you need to know; every click to make.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Important Tip!</span> To undo anything, just like in your word processor, use Ctrl+Z. It will undo the last thing you did and you can work your way back. Write that down and stick it some place you can find it when you panic. ðŸ™‚

6. Look at the image area (area <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span>). You will notice at the bottom it says 851 x 315. This is the size of the Facebook page cover photo in pixels. (More on that later. I mean, there&#8217;s enough information here already.)

See that little gray box in the lower left? This is where your profile photo is going to overlay your cover photo. Note: The placement of the profile photo is different for the Facebook _page_ cover photo and the FacebookÂ _profile_ cover photo. This template is adjusted for the FacebookÂ _page._

The gray box is just a place holder. Before we save your final file, we&#8217;re going to turn that layer off.

What do I mean by layers? Think of the layers as a stack of transparent sheets laying on top of each other. The way we&#8217;re going to make this image, we&#8217;re only going to put one item on each layer. Don&#8217;t worry if that doesn&#8217;t make sense. As we go along I&#8217;ll explain it a little more. Just for now, don&#8217;t worry about color-coordinating that gray box with anything, because it won&#8217;t be there in your final file. It&#8217;s just a place holder to make sure you don&#8217;t put anything important there.

In the next post, we&#8217;ll start making the pretty stuff for your facebook page cover photo! We&#8217;ll start with [how to make an author logo using Pixlr](http://esivy.com/?p=1335) &#8211; -basically your name and some sort of tagline.(link won&#8217;t work if the tutorial isn&#8217;t live yet)
