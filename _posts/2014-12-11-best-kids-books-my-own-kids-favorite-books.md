There many lists claiming to be lists of the best kids books. Lists of hundreds — if not thousands— of kids’ books that are carefully curated for their “literary merit.” I&#8217;m not a literature expert, just a children&#8217;s book author – but most of all a mom – who loves reading, with a house full of readers.<!--more-->

I don&#8217;t know about you, but when I read those long lists I find myself asking, &#8220;Yeah, but are the books really any fun to read?&#8221; Because when it comes to reading for kids, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m most concerned about, fun. <a href="http://esivy.com/?p=2766" target="_blank">When a kid likes to read — <em>loves</em> to read — because it&#8217;s fun, the rest will follow.</a>

And that&#8217;s why the books on these best kids book lists are what _my kids _consider the best books. The ones they’ve read over and over, remember fondly, and the ones who were a great distraction — a friend — in times of need. And that’s why there aren’t “neat numbers.” I didn’t add books just to get to 10 or 20 in a list.

Below are the lists I&#8217;ll be covering in this post series. Links will go live after the posts go live, and you&#8217;ll be able to use this as a reference list to navigate your way around.
