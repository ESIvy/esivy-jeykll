I&#8217;m a bit late announcing this on the blog, but I was so thrilled when <a href="http://reads4tweens.com/" target="_blank">Reads4Tweens</a> came out with a <a href="http://reads4tweens.com/category/best-2012/" target="_blank">best books of 2012</a> list during the holidays. Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#8217;s Secret made the list!

Reads4Tweens says Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#8217;s Secret is &#8230; &#8220;a <span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Droid Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 22px;">wonderful book for young readers who love mermaids and princesses. It’s in a modern setting, so it’s easy for them to put themselves in Miri’s shoes (fins?).&#8221;<!--more--></span>

Reads4Tweens was started by a mom trying to find good books for her kids. But she also happens to be very qualified to talk about children&#8217;s books. She has a degree in children&#8217;s literature, she&#8217;s taught literature in middle school and high school, and she&#8217;s currently a freelance editor. Needless to say, a great review from this caliber of reviewer was especially gratifying.
