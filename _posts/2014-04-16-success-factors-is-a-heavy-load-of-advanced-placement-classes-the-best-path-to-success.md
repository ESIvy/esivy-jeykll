It started me wondering, is there a reason for high school students to have tremendously heavy workloads?

At the time, my kids were still in elementary school. Their homework load usually wasn&#8217;t unreasonable. There were a few times that it did get heavy, but there were always parents who complained louder than we did, and for the most part things worked out fine. But I continued to think about how we were going to tackle high school. (And I noticed that I just said &#8220;we,&#8221; just like the mom talking about how &#8220;we&#8221; had homework to do. Still, this isn&#8217;t _doing_ our kids work.)<!--more-->

What I found was that common &#8220;wisdom&#8221; seems to be that to get into college you have to take all the Advanced placement courses (AP courses) your school offers, be involved in multiple extra-curriculars (and preferably be an officer in many of them), do community service (even better if you start your own charity), and play a sport. You need all that to show that you&#8217;re a serious student who&#8217;s still a well-rounded person.

Does that make you a well-rounded person, or just exhausted?

At some point I ran across the blog, <a title="Study Hacks" href="http://calnewport.com/blog/" target="_blank">Study Hacks, Decoding Patterns of Success.</a> The focus of the blog has evolved, but you can still find <a href="http://calnewport.com/about/" target="_blank">Cal Newport&#8217;s</a> posts about <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/archive/" target="_blank">student advice</a> in the archives.

In the blog posts, his philosophy is best summed up by this quote from his post about <a title="study hacks about" href="http://calnewport.com/blog/about/" target="_blank">what the blog Study Hacks is about:</a>

_<span style="color: #0000ff;">&#8220;&#8230; reject the idea that doing well in school requires stressful overwork, and instead promote a philosophy of simplicity: <strong>do less, but do what you do much better.&#8221;</strong></span>_

As someone who always tried to excel at _everything _I did, I found this idea appealing. What was the appeal? Well, I&#8217;m not convinced that my own path was the best way. And the stress of homework load and difficult classes in high school seems to have only intensified since I was in school. I can&#8217;t imagine being even more stressed out than I was.

To back up this claim, there are a lot of posts about kids who got into top-notch schools and got top scholarships, not by doing more activities and winning more awards than all the other applicants, but by pursuing a passion and becoming an interesting person.

Some of those posts are:

(Hint: it&#8217;s not just making your list longer and your grades higher.)

These posts and other information I was hearing made me start thinking that our top achieving high school students aren&#8217;t running a race. Instead, they&#8217;re on a treadmill.

And someone keeps increasing the speed.

Everyone is so desperately trying to keep up, that most have failed to notice that they&#8217;re not getting anywhere.

We haven&#8217;t been through the college admissions process yet. Do you have any experiences you could share about AP loads and college admissions? Leave a comment!
