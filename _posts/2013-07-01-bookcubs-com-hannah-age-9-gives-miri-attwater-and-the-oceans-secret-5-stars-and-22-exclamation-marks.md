For kid&#8217;s books, there&#8217;s nothing better than a book review _by_Â kids.

Here&#8217;s what Hannah, age 9, over at <a href="http://www.book-cubs.com/2013/06/24/miri-attwater-and-the-oceans-secret-by-e-s-ivy/" target="_blank">BookCubs</a> had to say about Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#8217;s Secret.

<span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Century Gothic', AppleGothic, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;"><span style="color: magenta;">If you like funny fantasy books youâ€™ll love this. It is fantastic. If you do not think it is great, you are crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<!--more--></span></span>

And as a writer, there&#8217;s nothing better than a kid&#8217;s review like that. ðŸ™‚ And yes, all those exclamation points are her&#8217;s &#8211; I didn&#8217;t add any.

Her favorite part was Miri&#8217;s dinner with the Queen. That makes me happy, because I had fun writing it. (Sneak Peek &#8211; there&#8217;ll be another fancy dinner with funny dishes in Book 2.)

Before I wrote about Miri&#8217;s first meal in Kai Kaona, I ate some seaweed salad! It wasn&#8217;t too bad. A little rubbery. ðŸ™‚ Some of the rest came from memories I have &#8211; like when someone advised me to order &#8220;seafood&#8221; noodles in Japan and it turned out to be &#8220;seaweed&#8221; noodles.

And the time at a fancy restaurant in New Orleans that my grandmother was served a baked fish with its head still on. She was a proper Southern lady, a phenomenal cook, and had cleaned a few fish from my grandfather&#8217;s catch in her day. She would never have served a fish head at her table. She sent that fish right back to the kitchen to be properly prepared!
