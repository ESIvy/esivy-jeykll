  Erica&#8217;s son read the book and said, &#8220;It was good, even though it was a book for girls.&#8221; ðŸ™‚ I love that quote!

  I&#8217;ll readily admit that Miri definitely has &#8220;girl appeal.&#8221; So I think that means the story has to be twice as good for a boy to enjoy it. I find that comment high praise, indeed.
