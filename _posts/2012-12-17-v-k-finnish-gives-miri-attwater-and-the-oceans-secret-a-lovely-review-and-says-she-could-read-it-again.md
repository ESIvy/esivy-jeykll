V.K. said &#8220;I read _Miri Attwater and the Oceanâ€™s Secret_ with my 3rd grade daughter, and it was a big hit!&#8230;The story was &#8230; dotted with witty puns to go with the water theme. &#8230;[the character] Miri &#8230; had such a great spread of silliness about her, original humor, and fun, child-like way of looking at the events around her.&#8221;<!--more-->

You can read the full review over at <a href="http://www.vkfinnish.com/archives/1469" target="_blank">V.K. Finnish&#8217;s blog</a> or on V.K.&#8217;s <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/451716622" target="_blank">Goodreads page</a>.

Thank you V.K. I&#8217;m so glad you liked it! And I&#8217;m almost finished with Book 2, so that fans can follow Miri&#8217;s adventures in the underwater mermaid colony of Kai Kaona!
