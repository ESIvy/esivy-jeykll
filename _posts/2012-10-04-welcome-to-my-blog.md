Hi, I&#8217;m E.S. Ivy, writer of fun, middle grade fiction. I do a lot of research for my books, so if you&#8217;re not careful you might accidentally learn something. ðŸ™‚

This blog will cover a variety of topics related to my books and turning kids into avid readers by making reading fun. I have a background in science and I&#8217;m also pretty craftyÂ  (I&#8217;ve published crafts in Family Fun Magazine) so all of that will influence the blog. For my first series, Miri Attwater, I also did a lot of research into the structure of governments and how they have evolved over time, so you&#8217;ll find a little bit of history as well. Posts should occur about once a week, starting &#8230;. um&#8230;.. soon, I hope!

Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#8217;s Secret is currently available in Amazon! After I get all my blogs and webpages up and running, get the final draft of Book 2 off to proof readers, and learn how to sing on my <a href="https://twitter.com/ESIvy" target="_blank">E.S. Ivy twitter account</a>, I&#8217;ll start getting The Ocean&#8217;s Secret up on other platforms including Barnes and Noble, Smashwords, and Kobo. If you have a vote for which platform you want it on first, let me know in the comments.

<p style="text-align:left;">
  For now I&#8217;ll just leave you with a larger version of The Ocean&#8217;s Secret to gaze at. I designed the cover and Techno Tim, my resident tech guy, made it a reality. I even got a refresher course in Photoshop and drew in some of the coral! Doesn&#8217;t the yellow one in the lower right hand corner look particularly nice?
