Book cover design is fun! Challenging, but fun. In past posts we&#8217;ve showed you [the original pencil sketch of Miri](http://esivy.com/behind-the-books/new-website-new-cover-miri-attwater-oceans-secret/ "New Cover for Miri Attwater and the Oceanâ€™s Secret Coming Soon") and [the first colored version of her face](http://esivy.com/?p=1065).

Or course, for the new cover of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Attwater-Oceans-Mermaid-Princess-Adventures-ebook/dp/B0087451I2" target="_blank">Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#8217;s Secret</a>, we needed Miri to be more than just a floating head.<!--more--> Ask TechnoTim, getting the hands right was the hardest part. I&#8217;m really good at telling him when something doesn&#8217;t look quite right. ðŸ™‚ Keep in mind that while TechnoTim is drawing this, he&#8217;s also teaching himself how to use a new computer art program!

The first cover was made in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopfamily.html" target="_blank">PhotoShop</a>, which he&#8217;s used for years. To make this kind of illustration, he needed to work in vector art. This time he&#8217;s making the cover in <a href="http://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>. (Which is free.)

Besides drawing more of Miri, the hair changed a bit too. It&#8217;s shorter and the curls are a bit softer. But, there&#8217;s still the same mistake from last week. Have you spotted it yet?
