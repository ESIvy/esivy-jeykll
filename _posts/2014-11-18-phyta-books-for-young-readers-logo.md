In last weeks post about [the paperback cover for Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#8217;s Secret,](http://esivy.com/?p=2637) I mentioned that there was a little something that I&#8217;m especially proud of. Well, here it is, but bigger.<!--more-->

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2645" src="http://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/phyta_logo_color-300x424.jpg" alt="Phyta Books for Young Readers" width="300" height="424" srcset="https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/phyta_logo_color-300x424.jpg 300w, https://esivy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/phyta_logo_color-300x424-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> 

It&#8217;s the new logo for Phyta Publishing, Phyta Books for Young readers! And I&#8217;m especially proud of it because I not only designed it, but I drew it myself using Inkscape. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> is open source free software.) It was my first experience drawing something in vector graphics.

&#8220;Phyta&#8221; means plants and makes me think about green plants and growth. Phyta Publishing is all about growing readers!

For the longest time I couldn&#8217;t figure out why &#8220;phyta&#8221; was so much more familiar to me than most people. Turns out that &#8220;-phyta&#8221; is the ending of all the plant division names in biology classification.

It&#8217;s also often found in other names relating to plants, such as &#8220;gametophyte.&#8221; A &#8220;fern gametophyte&#8221; is a tiny fern plant that&#8217;s part of the fern&#8217;s reproductive cycle. And that just happens to be what I studied, experimented on, and looked at under a microscope by the thousands to earn my PhD in plant biology. It appears that from the &#8220;magic&#8221; in Miri Attwater that is explained imaginatively by science, to the naming of the publishing company, I just can&#8217;t get away from my science background!
