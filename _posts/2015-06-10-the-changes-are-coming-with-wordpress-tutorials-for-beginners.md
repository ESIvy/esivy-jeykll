It can take even longer if you&#8217;re trying to do thing &#8220;right.&#8221; For example, Austin has a very active WordPress community, so earlier this week I attended a WordPress MeetUp about web site security. And I wrote a post, [WordPress Security Tips for Beginners.](http://esivy.com/wordpress-security-tips/)

During this process, you might notice some things on this blog preparing for the move. If you don&#8217;t see it already, soon I&#8217;ll be using the template Foodie Pro with Genesis on this site, just so I can check out how it&#8217;s going to work. But it won&#8217;t be completely styled, so a few things might look out of place.

The upside to how thoroughly I&#8217;m researching everything, if you happened to design your own website, or want to, I&#8217;m working on a pretty extensive series of WordPress tutorials for beginners to the more advanced, on everything from buying your domain, setting up local test sites on your own computer, migrating a designed site to another location and styling Foodie Pro for Genesis into a Lifestyle blog. So be sure to keep up with the changes or sign up to follow my blog in email!
